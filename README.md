# JavaScript_Challenge

This project consists of two main parts: 

LEVEL 1: Automatic Table and Date Search
- created a basic HTML web page 
- used a UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects and wrote code that appended a table to the web page and added new rows of data for each UFO sighting

LEVEL 2: Multiple Search Categories
- created multiple tags and wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for sightings
